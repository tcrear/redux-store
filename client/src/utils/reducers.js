/*
  The reducers file is where we manage state for all the entities we are dealing
  with in the application. 

  The key thing about reducers is that they never modify the current state. They make 
  a copy of the current state, modify the copy, and replace the current with the
  new state. This makes it possible for state updates to work predictably, and to also 
  easily undo/rollback state changes.

  Notice how all actions which dictate state are defined here. Each action is defined 
  only once and can be called anytime needed. When called, it will always behave the 
  exact same way.
